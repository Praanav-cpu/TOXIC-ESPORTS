                Snipers are the most feared and respected players in any Battle Royale game. 
                A skilled sniper can single-handedly change the outcome of a match by taking out 
                enemies from long-range before they even know what hit them. If you're just starting 
                with sniping in BGMI, don't get discouraged.
