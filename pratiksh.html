                    In Battlegrounds Mobile India (BGMI), a supporter is a vital role in the squad, primarily focusing on assisting the team rather 
                    than racking up kills. Here's a detailed description:

                    Supporter Role in BGMI:
                      Role:

                         The supporter ensures the team's survival and success by providing backup, managing utilities, and helping teammates 
                         in tough situations. They typically stay behind the aggressive players (attackers) and focus on healing, reviving, and keeping 
                         the team well-equipped.
                
                   Key Responsibilities:

                         Utility Management: Carries additional medical supplies, grenades (smoke, frag, stun), and extra ammunition to share with 
                         the team when needed.
                         Healing and Reviving: Quick to heal teammates during or after fights and prioritize reviving downed players.
                  
                   Scout and Information Gathering: 
                         Moves with the team and provides crucial information on enemy positions, ambushes, or safe zones from 
                         a strategic vantage point.
                   
                   Cover Fire: 
                         While not leading attacks, they offer suppressive fire or cover fire to distract enemies while attackers
                         push or retreat.

                   Vehicle Management: 
                        Often the one ensuring the squad has a vehicle and making sure it is ready for quick 
                        rotations or emergency getaways.

                   Playstyle:

                        The supporter usually plays a mid-range or defensive position, rarely engaging in direct combat unless necessary. 
                        They tend to use DMRs (like SKS or Mini14) or ARs (like M416) to support long- and mid-range combat, allowing them 
                        to help from a safe distance.

                  Communication:

                        Effective communication is key, as they often relay critical information like enemy movements or gear status. 
                        They coordinate with the team for effective ambushes, safe revives, and rotations.
                
               
                  Awareness:
                       Always aware of teammates’ health, inventory, and positioning.

                Quick Reflexes:
                   Fast at healing or reviving in high-pressure situations.
                   
                Strategic Thinking:
                   Understands the game’s map and dynamics to help position the team favorably.

           In essence, a supporter in BGMI is a selfless and highly strategic role that requires strong teamwork, communication, 
                                      and game knowledge to maximize the squad’s performance.
